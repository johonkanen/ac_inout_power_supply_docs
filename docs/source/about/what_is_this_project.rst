What is this project?
====================

This project is a bidirectional lab power supply. The idea is to have a programmable supply with which I can relatively easily develop grid connected devices, or other power supplies. The bidirectionality allows the power supply to work as either a load or a source.

The power supply is designed with a grid side inverter and a load side inverter and these are galvanically isolated with a dual active bridge DC/DC converter.
