Simulations and tests for IO
============================

The most difficult part of any embedded system is the interfacing from the code to outside world. This requires understanding the documentation and using different interfaces and peripherals exactly according to the intended way. The difficulty is that there is rarely a possiblity for simulating the used configuration unless test driving it with the actual hardware.

With FPGA IO are developed exactly the same way as any other modules. We can use simulations and tests just as with any other modules. This allows us to run the same code in a simulation that we run in the actual hardware.
